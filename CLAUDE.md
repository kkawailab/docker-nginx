# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Docker tutorial repository containing documentation for Docker beginners in Japanese. The repository currently contains a single tutorial file that covers Docker basics, installation, and creating simple web applications with Nginx.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains:
- `Docker_Beginner_Tutorial.markdown` - A comprehensive Japanese-language tutorial covering Docker fundamentals

## Development Commands

Since this is a documentation-only repository, there are no build, test, or lint commands. The primary focus is on maintaining and updating the Docker tutorial documentation.

## Working with this Repository

When updating or extending the tutorial:
- Maintain the Japanese language throughout the documentation
- Keep examples simple and beginner-friendly
- Test all Docker commands before documenting them
- Ensure code examples are properly formatted in markdown code blocks

## Docker Commands Referenced in Tutorial

The tutorial covers these key Docker operations:
- `docker pull <image>` - Download Docker images
- `docker run` - Start containers
- `docker ps` - List running containers
- `docker stop <container-id>` - Stop containers
- `docker build -t <name> .` - Build custom images from Dockerfile

## Future Development

This repository appears to be in early stages. Future additions might include:
- Additional tutorials for advanced Docker topics
- Example Dockerfiles and docker-compose configurations
- Hands-on exercises with sample applications
